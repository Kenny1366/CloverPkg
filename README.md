First of all, Im just PHP coder, with poor knowledge of C. Thats why I cannot accept any issues on this repo regarding all modificatons that been made, so feel free to add yours on your own. Not for production / daily usage. This project is intended for general use and no warranty is implied for suitability to any given task. I hold no responsibility for your setup or any damage done while using/installing/modifying. I create this fork (start on mid 2016 based on revision [3884](https://sourceforge.net/p/cloverefiboot/code/3884/tree/)) with the following task & goals:

- 64 bit UEFI with native NVRAM support only.
- EDK2 patches free & reindent all sources.
- Simplify all internal patches (DSDT, devices, predifined vendor / product name, etc).
- Simplify GUI & tweaks.

- No GUI mouse support

Tested with GCC49, GCC5, XCODE5, XCLANG & VS2015x86 toolchain.
